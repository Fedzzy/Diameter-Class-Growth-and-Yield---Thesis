Contains various functions and processes used to compare various Weibull Parameter Recovery Methods

This repository contains the work completed by Josh Bankston (graduate student) and Dr. Charles Sabatia (Former biometrics professor at 
Missippi State University.  The purpose of this work is to determine the effects of plot size (i.e. sample size) and prediction model form
used to predict diameter moments/percentiles of southern loblolly pine stands on the accuracy of recovered diameter distributions.  
Diameter distributions were recovered using three commonly used methods: (1) method of moments (2) hybrid method (3) percentile method.
